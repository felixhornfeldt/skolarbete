            <p>From the day we arrive on the planet
                And blinking, step into the Sun
                There's more to be seen than can ever be seen
                More to do than can ever be done
                Some say eat or be eaten
                Some say live and let live
                But all are agreed as they join the stampede
                You should never take more than you give
                In the circle of life
                It's the wheel of fortune
                It's the leap of faith
                It's the band of hope
                Till we find our place
                On the path unwinding
                In the circle, the circle of life
                Some of us fall by the wayside
                And some of us soar to the stars
                And some of us sail through our troubles
                And some have to live with the scars
                There's far too much to take in here
                More to find than can ever be found
                But the Sun rolling high through the sapphire sky
                Keeps great and small on the endless round
                In the circle of life
                It's the wheel of fortune
                It's the leap of faith
                It's the band of hope
                Till we find our place
                On the path unwinding
                In the circle, the circle of life
                It's the wheel of fortune
                It's the leap of faith
                It's the band of hope
                Till we find our place
                On the path unwinding
                In the circle, the circle of life
                On the path unwinding
                In the circle, the circle of life</p>
